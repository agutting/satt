WordPress Troubleshooting Tool

SATT is a tool designed to assist in support of common WordPress CMS issues such as faulty plugins/themes, lost credentials, corrupted core installation files, backup/restore, updating PHP configuration settings, and more.

The tool is designed for speedy use in a large number of different WordPress sites, potentially all with different hosting providers, and so is organized into a single file so it can be quickly uploaded and easily removed after the fact.

To use, simply drop satt.php into the root directory of a WordPress installation and visit yourwebsiteaddress.com/satt.php in a browser.

Note: Due to its ability to modify user data and temporarily disable other security measures, it is a major security risk to leave this file in the WordPress installation directory.  This file should be uploaded only during troubleshooting and removed afterward.
